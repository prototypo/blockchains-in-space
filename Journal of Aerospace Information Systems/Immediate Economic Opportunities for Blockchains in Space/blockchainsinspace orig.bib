	Abstract = {Space situation awareness ({SSA}) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance {SSA}, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control ({AC}) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of {SSA} systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized {AC} system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control ({BlendCAC}), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based {AC} mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in {SSA} networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the {BlendCAC} leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the {BlendCAC} scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained {AC} solution for space system toward {SSA}.},

	Abstract = {The Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) is a framework for representing information in the Web. This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all {RDF}-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: {RDF} graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be {IRIs}, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. {RDF} datasets are used to organize collections of {RDF} graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. {RDF} 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in {IRIs} within {RDF} graphs.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale Semantic Web applications require large-scale storage of Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) information and a means to analyze that information via the Web Ontology Language ({OWL}) in near real time. The Kowari Metastore was designed as a purpose-built {RDF} database to fulfill this requirement. Kowari provides a scalable, transaction-safe storage infrastructure for {RDF} statements and an expressive query language for their analysis, with or without the use of a subset of the {RDF} Schema and/or {OWL} languages. {OWL} Lite plus the full cardinality constraints from {OWL} Full are currently supported via the interactive Tucana Query Language ({iTQL}) or the Simple Ontology Framework {API} ({SOFA}). Kowari's native quad-store indexing scheme has been shown to scale to hundreds of millions of {RDF} statements on a single machine.

	Abstract = {Summary Linked Data presents the Linked Data model in plain, jargon-free language to Web developers. Avoiding the overly academic terminology of the Semantic Web, this new book presents practical techniques, using everyday tools like {JavaScript} and Python. About this Book The current Web is mostly a collection of linked documents useful for human consumption. The evolving Web includes data collections that may be identified and linked so that they can be consumed by automated processes. The W3C approach to this is Linked Data and it is already used by Google, Facebook, {IBM}, Oracle, and government agencies worldwide. Linked Data presents practical techniques for using Linked Data on the Web via familiar tools like {JavaScript} and Python. You'll work step-by-step through examples of increasing complexity as you explore foundational concepts such as {HTTP} {URIs}, the Resource Description Framework ({RDF}), and the {SPARQL} query language. Then you'll use various Linked Data document formats to create powerful Web applications and mashups. Written to be immediately useful to Web developers, this book requires no previous exposure to Linked Data or Semantic Web technologies. Purchase of the print book includes a free {eBook} in {PDF}, Kindle, and {ePub} formats from Manning Publications.

@book{wood_linking_2010,
	Abstract = {Enterprise data is growing at a much faster rate than traditional technologies allow. The World Wide Web is the only information system that scales to the degree that it does and is robust to both changes and failure of components. Most software does not work nearly as well as the Web does. Applying the Web's architectural principles (versus using the public Web directly) for enterprise problems maybe the only way to effectively address the current and future information glut.   Linking Enterprise Data is an edited volume contributed by worldwide leaders in Semantic Web research, standards development and early adopters of Semantic Web standards and techniques. Linking enterprise data is the application of World Wide Web architecture principles to real-world information management issues faced by commercial, not-for-profit and government enterprises. The first section of this book will address business, technical and social values of applying Web architecture to enterprise content. An important focus of the first section will be the building of social (human-centered) communities to curate distributed data. The second section, Infrastructure, will address the need and options for persistent identifiers of data, terms and vocabularies for use by enterprise architects, and data storage and retrieval infrastructure appropriate for use. Case studies and examples that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architectures are presented in the last section of Linking Enterprise Data.  About this book:    Provides practical approaches to addressing common information management issues by the application of leading edge research.   Application approaches are based on international standards.   Includes case studies and examples that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architectures.   This book targets professionals working as {CTOs}, {CIOs}, enterprise architects, project managers and application developers in commercial, not-for-profit and government organizations concerned with scalability, flexibility and robustness of information management systems and the Semantic Web. Advanced-level students and researchers focusing on computer science will also find this book valuable as a secondary text or reference book.},

@book{wood_programming_1999,
	Abstract = {The Internet's "killer app" is not the World Wide Web or Push technologies: it is humble electronic mail. More people use email than any other Internet application. As the number of email users swells, and as email takes on an ever greater role in personal and business communication, Internet mail protocols have become not just an enabling technology for messaging, but a programming interface on top of which core applications are built.Programming Internet Email unmasks the Internet Mail System and shows how a loose federation of connected networks have combined to form the world's largest and most heavily trafficked message system.Programming Internet Email tames the Internet's most popular messaging service. For programmers building applications on top of email capabilities, and power users trying to get under the hood of their own email systems, Programming Internet Email stands out as an essential guide and reference book. In typical O'Reilly fashion,Programming Internet Email covers the topic with nineteen tightly written chapters and five useful appendixes.Following a thorough introduction to the Internet Mail System, the book is divided into five parts:Part I covers email formats, from basic text messages to the guts of {MIME}. Secure email message formats ({OpenPGP} and S/{MIME}), mailbox formats and other commonly used formats are detailed in this reference section.Part {II} describes Internet email protocols: {SMTP} and {ESMTP}, {POP}3 and {IMAP}4. Each protocol is covered in detail to expose the Internet Mail System's inner workings.Part {III} provides a solid {API} reference for programmers working in Perl and Java. Class references are given for commonly used Perl modules that relate to email and the Java Mail {API}.Part {IV} provides clear and concise examples of how to incorporate email capabilities into your applications. Examples are given in both Perl and Java.Part V covers the future of email on the Internet. Means and methods for controlling spam email and newly proposed Internet mail protocols are discussed.Appendixes to Programming Internet Email provide a host of explanatory information and useful references for the programmer and avid user alike, including a comprehensive list of Internet {RFCs} relating to email, {MIME} types and a list of email related {URLs}.Programming Internet Email will answer all of your questions about mail and extend your abilities into this most popular messaging frontier.},

@article{hyland-wood_scale-free_2006,
	Abstract = {Software collaboration graphs for two Open Source software projects written in the Java programming language, the Kowari Metastore and {JRDF}, were analyzed for fifteen-month periods of development. Collaboration graphs were produced at the package, class and method levels. The collaboration graphs were found to form networks which exhibited approximately scale-free properties at all three levels and during each period analyzed. This finding tends to support claims made by others that software class collaboration graphs approximate scale-free networks and provides new insights that they seem to retain the scale-free properties across different levels of granularity and over the course of their development life cycle. Significant differences between the magnitudes of power law exponents identified and those found in C and C++ applications by previous researchers are noted and discussed. Specifically, only the method-level collaboration graphs were found to have power law exponents in the most common range for scale-free networks (2 {\textless} γ {\textless} 3).},

	Abstract = {Linking Government Data provides a practical approach to addressing common information management issues. The approaches taken are based on international standards of the World Wide Web Consortium. Linking Government Data gives both the costs and benefits of using linked data techniques with government data; describes how agencies can fulfill their missions with less cost; and recommends how intra-agency culture must change to allow public presentation of linked data. Case studies from early adopters of linked data approaches in international governments are presented in the last section of the book. Linking Government Data is designed as a professional book for those working in Semantic Web research and standards development, and for early adopters of Semantic Web standards and techniques.

	Abstract = {Many governments have recently mandated the open publication of more information to the public, in attempts to facilitate the maintenance of open societies and in support of governmental accountability and transparency initiatives. Publication of structured data on the World Wide Web is in itself insufficient; in order to make use of such data, members of the public can best absorb data when it can be used with other published data. Linked Data approaches address key requirements of open government by providing a family of international standards and best practices for the publication, dissemination and reuse of structured data. Further, Linked Data, unlike previous data formatting and publication approaches, provides a simple mechanism for combining data from multiple sources across the Web. This chapter provides a six-step ``cookbook'' to model, create, publish and announce government Linked Data. We'll highlight the role of the World Wide Web Consortium, an international standards organization and its member organizations who are currently driving specifications and best practices for the publication of governmental data. The chapter concludes with guidance on the social contract government agencies implicitly adopt when they publish Linked Data on the Web.},

We propose the collection of software system metadata which may include functional and nonfunctional requirements documentation, metrics, the success or failure of tests and the means by which various components interact or were intended to interact. We attempt to record and track changes to the metadata and use it to proactively notify developers of changing requirements and quality measurements which may impact farther development. This research uses semantic Web techniques such as {RDF}, {OWL} and {SPARQL} to encode system metadata and discusses the particular advantages that these techniques offer over other proposals. Specifically, we show how the use of an {OWL}-{DL} ontology of software engineering concepts, {RDF} encoding of system metadata and {SPARQL} queries over the resulting {RDF} graph can be used to enable language-neutral relational navigation of software systems thus facilitating software understanding and maintenance.

	Abstract = {Software maintenance is, often by far, the largest portion of the software lifecycle in terms of both cost and time. Yet, in spite of thirty years of study of the mechanisms and attributes of maintenance activities, there exist a number of significant open problems in the field: Software still becomes unmaintainable with time.
Software maintenance failures result in significant economic costs because unmaintainable systems generally require wholesale replacement. Maintenance failures occur primarily because software systems and information about them diverge quickly in time. This divergence is typically a consequence of the loss of coupling between software components and system metadata that eventually results in an inability to understand or safely modify a system. Accurate documentation of software systems, long the proposed solution for maintenance problems, is rarely achieved and even more rarely maintained. Inaccurate documentation may exacerbate maintenance costs when it misdirects the understanding of maintainers.},

	Abstract = {Linked Data techniques rely upon common terminology in a manner similar to a relational database'vs reliance on a schema. Linked Data terminology anchors metadata descriptions and facilitates navigation of information. Common vocabularies ease the human, social tasks of understanding datasets sufficiently to construct queries and help to relate otherwise disparate datasets. Vocabulary terms must, when using the Resource Description Framework, be grounded in {URIs}. A current bestpractice on the World Wide Web is to serve vocabulary terms as Uniform Resource Locators ({URLs}) and present both human-readable and machine-readable representations to the public. Linked Data terminology published to {theWorldWideWeb} may be used by others without reference or notification to the publishing party. That presents a problem: Vocabulary publishers take on an implicit responsibility to maintain and publish their terms via the {URLs} originally assigned, regardless of the inconvenience such a responsibility may cause. Over the course of years, people change jobs, publishing organizations change Internet domain names, computers change {IP} addresses,systems administrators publish old material in new ways. Clearly, a mechanism is required to {manageWeb}-based vocabularies over a long term. This chapter places Linked Data vocabularies in context with the wider concepts of metadata in general and specifically metadata on the Web. Persistent identifier mechanisms are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on Persistent {URLs}, or {PURLs}. {PURLs} and {PURL} services are discussed in the context of Linked Data. Finally, historic weaknesses of {PURLs} are resolved by the introduction of a federation of {PURL} services to address needs specific to Linked Data.},

	Abstract = {Predictive maintenance ({PdM}) within asset management improves savings in operational cost, productivity, and safety management capabilities. While {PdM} can be administered using various methods, growing interest in Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) has lead to current state of the art {PdM} relying on machine learning ({ML}) technology. Like other tools used in {PdM} for asset management, standards for applying {ML} technology for {PdM} are required. This work introduces a standard of practice in regards to usage of asset data to develop {ML} analytic tools for {PdM}. It provides a standard method for ensuring asset data is in a form conducive to {ML} algorithms, and ensuring retention of asset information necessary for optimum {PdM} during the data transform. In the {ML} domain, it has been proven through research initiatives that the data structure used to train and test {ML} algorithms has a great impact on their performance and accuracy. Using poorly trained models for estimation due to improper data usage, can leave some {AI}-based {PdM} tools vulnerable to high rates of inaccurate estimations. Thus, leading to value loss during an asset's life cycle.},

In this paper, we present a blueprint for the integration of {AI} into web-based text editors, and show that this contributes towards simplifying the writing task for authors. Our approach utilises the textual content of a document as input into existing artificial intelligence processes, extended with an {RDF} knowledge graph. The supplementary material from the {AI} partner is presented to an author for possible inclusion in their document. Our results from unmoderated observational user tests validate the premise that cognitive technology can simplify the writing task, and show that design is critical to the adoption of cognitive technologies. We conclude with lessons learned from deploying on-line observational tests, and share opportunities for future work.},

The authors discuss theories of software system descriptions in terms of Kuhn\&apos;s paradigms and the application of metadata to software. The authors then propose the collection of software system metadata, which may include functional and non-functional requirement documentation, metrics, the success or failure of tests and the means by which various components interact or were intended to interact. The authors show how changes to metadata may be recorded and tracked and propose how they may be used to proactively notify developers of changing requirements and quality measurements that may impact maintenance. The authors show how Semantic Web techniques can be used to enable language-neutral relational navigation of software systems, thus facilitating software understanding and maintenance. Proposed extensions to this research are outlined, including the development of a toolset for distributed software maintenance.},

A proliferating demand has created a growing reliance on satellites for communications, {GPS}, imagery, and other uses. The decreased cost of entry into the space industry has increased the number of entrants and also the number of satellites and the amount of space debris. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to spacecraft. Therefore, tracking these objects is crucial. Blockchain technology offers a unique solution to this problem by utilizing functions, processes, and information already incorporated into satellites while maintaining a maximum of forty-eight hours of data. The use of blockchain provides a high level of trusted positional data that can be used to predict and avoid collisions which will save billions of dollars and valuable time. This paper provides a technological design, rational, and risk analysis of this proposal.},

	Abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) has given rise to a vast network of connected smart objects, leading to the development of cyber-physical pervasive frameworks. Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth and interest in developing smart systems, enabling the identification of innovative solutions for industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors. Various applications have been built and deployed in {IoT} space that leverage the increasing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification ({RFID}), wireless, mobile, and sensor devices. However, the current {IoT} paradigm with traditional cloud-based architecture is not scaled for the future, and requires all data to be transferred to a central point for analysis and action. This centralized processing model presents numerous challenges with the future need to connect hundreds of billions of devices. The major bottlenecks are associated with various dimensions such as cost of connectivity, meaningful value creation from sensor data, reliability, establishing digital trust, traceability, preventing concentration of power, unmanageable complexity, security, privacy, and latency. One solution to overcome these hurdles is to bring the concept of decentralization to the {IoT} space to build distributed {IoT}. This paper presents the current state of the research on {IoT} and its potential business use cases along with a case study on distributed {IoT}. It also discusses various challenges and opportunities in decentralized ecosystems, along with open research questions and future directions.},

@article{burleigh_delay-tolerant_2003,
	Abstract = {Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a "least common denominator" protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking ({DTN}) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the {DTN} architecture promises easier deployment and extension.{\textbackslash}},

	Abstract = {Orbital debris ({OD}) remains as an obstacle to further space development. While efforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number of debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. Active debris removal ({ADR}) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic model for {ADR} remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of removal can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain platform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global cooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in exchange with proofs of {ADR}. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through contributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal of debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have generalized this concept as proof of disposal, which, we believe, provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital currency than many Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering in practice today. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each {ADR} and automated pricing of tokens that represent the {OD} being removed are indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is ongoing.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new replication algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. We believe that Byzantinefault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior. Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant {NFS} service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that our service is only 3\% slower than a standard unreplicated {NFS}.},

First off, there is no specific "client" which sends out requests and waits for the results. Instead, all of the validators can be seen as clients. Furthermore, to keep the blockchain progressing, a proposer will be continuously selected in each round to create block proposal for consensus. Also, for each consensus result, we expect to generate a verifiable new block rather than a bunch of read/write operations to the file system.},

	Abstract = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or intrinsic value and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored coins), the ownership of an underlying physical device (smart property), non-fungible assets such as domain names (Namecoin), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules (smart contracts) or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations ({DAOs}). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency.

In this article we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases --- Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

	Abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a messageto be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \% on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cpexist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardlessof the actual values of the bounds A and Cp.In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardlessof when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensusprotocols are given for various casesof partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most casesthat our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensusprotocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant ``distributed clocks'' that allow partially synchronous processorsto reach some approximately common notion of time.},

	Abstract = {Predictive maintenance is the monitoring of an asset's condition over its life cycle to provide a prognosis for when maintenance is required. Prior to prognosis, an asset's life cycle is modeled by a health indicator ({HI}) which is derived from sensor measurements and describes an asset's degradation over a life cycle. Often an asset's {HI} is accompanied by a health stage ({HS}) division, which describes the asset's life cycle condition in discrete states. Generally, {HSs} are discrete representations generated from discrete state transition models, dynamic state space models, or subjectively defined thresholds, which use sensor measurements to provide a {HS} division related to an asset's life cycle degradation. {HS} division methods are often designed for a specific asset in which {HS} division is based on user assumptions and not generalizable to different asset types or asset data representations. Also, {HS} division methods are often limited to a bi-state {HS} division (normal and failure), in which unobservable states are often generalized transition states. As assets become more complex and require multivariate measurements, more advanced methods are required to model an asset's degradation using {HIs} and {HSs}. This work introduces Relative Entropy Weibull-{SAX} ({REWS}), a data-driven {HI} and {HS} degradation modeling method for multivariate asset data. {REWS} constructs a {HI} using relative entropy to represent an asset's condition as a change of entropy during its life cycle. The relative entropy representation is then discretized into {HS} divisions using a Weibull distribution based Symbolic Aggregate {approXimation}. {REWS}'s utility is demonstrated on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset which describes the life cycle observations of multiple aircraft engines.},

	Abstract = {In industrialised nations, we take for granted that knowledge is acquired and shared through a written medium, and yet the actual task of writing remains a hard skill to master. In this paper, we present a blueprint for the integration of artificial intelligence ({AI}) into Web-based text editors, and show that this contributes towards simplifying the writing task for authors. Our approach utilises the textual content of a document as input into existing artificial intelligence processes, extended with an {RDF} knowledge graph. The supplementary material from the {AI} partner is presented to an author for possible inclusion in their document. We separately evaluated two approaches to the presentation of linguistic tone analysis into editors. Our results from unmoderated observational user tests validate the premise that cognitive technology can simplify the writing task, and show that design is critical to the adoption of cognitive technologies. We conclude with lessons learned from deploying informal qualitative research sessions and online observational tests, and share opportunities for future work. We note that merely applying {AI} or any new technology to a human activity is patently insufficient. Our limited experience and evaluation suggest that design and user testing are necessary activities for adoption and acceptance.},

@inproceedings{green_mitigation_2018,
	Abstract = {Previous activities in developing satellite networks for telecommunications such as the {TelStar}, Relay and
Syncom satellite networks of the early 1960s through to the Iridium, Globalstar and {ORBCOMM} constellations of the 1990s were reserved to geostationary orbits and low-earth orbits with less than 100 satellites comprising their network. These satellite networks distinguished themselves by being business-to-government and business-to- business facing by contracting with government and domestic carriage and media providers in the supply of services. Customers for these services did not constitute either small to medium sized businesses, or an ordinary class of
persons that constituted the general public.
However, with the advent of what has been dubbed `{NewSpace}', new entrants into the market are developing
constellation satellite networks that operate in Low Earth Orbit ({LEO}). Unlike the legacy satellite telecommunication networks of the 1960s-1990s, these constellation satellite networks are focused on, inter alia, Internet of Things ({IOT}) devices, asset management and tracking, Wi-Fi hot-spotting, backhaul networking and contracting with small
business and the general public.
Regional examples of these new telecommunication heavyweights include Fleet - an Australian company
undertaking to launch 100 satellites into {LEO}, Sky and Space Global ({SAS}) - an Australian-British-Israeli consortium that intends to provide a constellation of 200 small satellites, {OneWeb}'s planned fleet of 650 satellites that may be expanded to 2 000 satellites, and, {SpaceX}'s planned {StarLink} network of 12 000 satellites. In addition to these planned telecommunication constellation networks, companies such as Spire and {PlanetLabs} intend to provide geospatial information through their own constellation networks to government and educational institutions
alongside the private sector.
Although propertisation of space and celestial bodies is prohibited pursuant to the Outer Space Treaty 1967 ({UN}),
orbits within space still remain rivalrous and commercially lucrative. By operating in a {LEO} environment, these satellite constellation networks automatically exclude competing services. For example, where one constellation network has an orbital plane or orbital shell, another constellation may not have the same orbital plane or orbital
shell.
Presently, the literature to date focuses on the allocation of spectrum bandwidth, and space traffic management
with a focus on orbital debris mitigation. This paper addresses these concerns and offers recommendations on how the risk of `natural' monopolies forming amongst low earth orbit for specific constellation satellite networks may be
mitigated under a variety of instruments available to both {UNOOSA} and the {ITU}.},

	Abstract = {Current radar-based air traffic service providers may preserve
privacy for military and corporate operations by procedurally preventing
public release of selected flight plans, position, and state data. The {FAA}
mandate for national adoption of Automatic Dependent Surveillance
Broadcast ({ADS}-B) in 2020 does not include provisions for maintaining these
same aircraft-privacy options, nor does it address the potential for spoofing,
denial of service, and other well-documented risk factors. This paper presents
an engineering prototype that embodies a design and method that may be
applied to mitigate these {ADS}-B security issues. The design innovation is the
use of an open source permissioned blockchain framework to enable aircraft
privacy and anonymity while providing a secure and efficient method for
communication with Air Traffic Services, Operations Support, or other
authorized entities. This framework features certificate authority, smart
contract support, and higher-bandwidth communication channels for private
information that may be used for secure communication between any specific
aircraft and any particular authorized member, sharing data in accordance
with the terms specified in the form of smart contracts. The prototype
demonstrates how this method can be economically and rapidly deployed in a
scalable modular environment.},

Although there are many physical and technical differences between the space and cyber domains, there are many similarities in the challenges confronting each domain, which have allowed some shared and similar approaches to addressing the problems.
Space and cyberspace are global capabilities and global enablers that together enable the United States, our partners, and allies to maintain a strategic advantage over potential adversaries and enhance our national security. These capabilities allow us to stay on the leading edge. They also enable economic growth, better standards of living, and rapid communica- tions that foster the financial and social links indispensable in our every- day lives. These links also allow us to maintain close real-time relations with our partners. Our cyber and space capabilities are connected in very real ways, both for our war fighters and for our society as a whole.},
