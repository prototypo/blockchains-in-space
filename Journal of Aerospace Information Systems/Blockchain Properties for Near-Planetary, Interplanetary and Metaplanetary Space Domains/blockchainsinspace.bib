@article{Aremu_Hyland-Wood_McAree_2019,
	Abstractnote = {Predictive maintenance is the monitoring of an asset's condition over its life cycle to provide a prognosis for when maintenance is required. Prior to prognosis, an asset's life cycle is modeled by a health indicator (HI) which is derived from sensor measurements and describes an asset's degradation over a life cycle. Often an asset's HI is accompanied by a health stage (HS) division, which describes the asset's life cycle condition in discrete states. Generally, HSs are discrete representations generated from discrete state transition models, dynamic state space models, or subjectively defined thresholds, which use sensor measurements to provide a HS division related to an asset's life cycle degradation. HS division methods are often designed for a specific asset in which HS division is based on user assumptions and not generalizable to different asset types or asset data representations. Also, HS division methods are often limited to a bi-state HS division (normal and failure), in which unobservable states are often generalized transition states. As assets become more complex and require multivariate measurements, more advanced methods are required to model an asset's degradation using HIs and HSs. This work introduces Relative Entropy Weibull-SAX (REWS), a data-driven HI and HS degradation modeling method for multivariate asset data. REWS constructs a HI using relative entropy to represent an asset's condition as a change of entropy during its life cycle. The relative entropy representation is then discretized into HS divisions using a Weibull distribution based Symbolic Aggregate approXimation. REWS's utility is demonstrated on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset which describes the life cycle observations of multiple aircraft engines.},

	Abstractnote = {Predictive maintenance (PdM) within asset management improves savings in operational cost, productivity, and safety management capabilities. While PdM can be administered using various methods, growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has lead to current state of the art PdM relying on machine learning (ML) technology. Like other tools used in PdM for asset management, standards for applying ML technology for PdM are required. This work introduces a standard of practice in regards to usage of asset data to develop ML analytic tools for PdM. It provides a standard method for ensuring asset data is in a form conducive to ML algorithms, and ensuring retention of asset information necessary for optimum PdM during the data transform. In the ML domain, it has been proven through research initiatives that the data structure used to train and test ML algorithms has a great impact on their performance and accuracy. Using poorly trained models for estimation due to improper data usage, can leave some AI-based PdM tools vulnerable to high rates of inaccurate estimations. Thus, leading to value loss during an asset's life cycle.},

While Elon Musk talks about colonizing Mars and Luxembourg has made asteroid mining a national priority, the essential building blocks for a space economy remain to be developed. Vast mineral wealth exists on the Moon, Mars, the asteroids, and beyond, but until those resources can be economically exploited, activities in space will remain government funded and priorities will be determined through politics. There are the exceptions of billionaires funding space activities for personal reasons, but that cannot lead to settlement of space. Activities in space are extremely costly. Generally other priorities have taken precedence over space.},

@article{burleigh_delay-tolerant_2003,
	Abstractnote = {Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a ``least common denominator'' protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the DTN architecture promises easier deployment and extension.},

	Abstractnote = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or intrinsic value and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored coins), the ownership of an underlying physical device (smart property), non-fungible assets such as domain names (Namecoin), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules (smart contracts) or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create ``contracts'' that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

	Abstractnote = {This paper describes a new replication algorithm that is able to tolerate Byzantine faults. We believe that Byzantinefault-tolerant algorithms will be increasingly important in the future because malicious attacks and software errors are increasingly common and can cause faulty nodes to exhibit arbitrary behavior. Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that our service is only 3% slower than a standard unreplicated NFS.},

In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cpexist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardlessof the actual values of the bounds A and Cp.In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardlessof when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensusprotocols are given for various casesof partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most casesthat our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given.

	Abstractnote = {Previous activities in developing satellite networks for telecommunications such as the TelStar, Relay and Syncom satellite networks of the early 1960s through to the Iridium, Globalstar and ORBCOMM constellations of the 1990s were reserved to geostationary orbits and low-earth orbits with less than 100 satellites comprising their network. These satellite networks distinguished themselves by being business-to-government and business-to- business facing by contracting with government and domestic carriage and media providers in the supply of services. Customers for these services did not constitute either small to medium sized businesses, or an ordinary class of persons that constituted the general public. However, with the advent of what has been dubbed `NewSpace', new entrants into the market are developing constellation satellite networks that operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Unlike the legacy satellite telecommunication networks of the 1960s-1990s, these constellation satellite networks are focused on, inter alia, Internet of Things (IOT) devices, asset management and tracking, Wi-Fi hot-spotting, backhaul networking and contracting with small business and the general public. Regional examples of these new telecommunication heavyweights include Fleet - an Australian company undertaking to launch 100 satellites into LEO, Sky and Space Global (SAS) - an Australian-British-Israeli consortium that intends to provide a constellation of 200 small satellites, OneWeb's planned fleet of 650 satellites that may be expanded to 2 000 satellites, and, SpaceX's planned StarLink network of 12 000 satellites. In addition to these planned telecommunication constellation networks, companies such as Spire and PlanetLabs intend to provide geospatial information through their own constellation networks to government and educational institutions alongside the private sector. Although propertisation of space and celestial bodies is prohibited pursuant to the Outer Space Treaty 1967 (UN), orbits within space still remain rivalrous and commercially lucrative. By operating in a LEO environment, these satellite constellation networks automatically exclude competing services. For example, where one constellation network has an orbital plane or orbital shell, another constellation may not have the same orbital plane or orbital shell. Presently, the literature to date focuses on the allocation of spectrum bandwidth, and space traffic management with a focus on orbital debris mitigation. This paper addresses these concerns and offers recommendations on how the risk of `natural' monopolies forming amongst low earth orbit for specific constellation satellite networks may be mitigated under a variety of instruments available to both UNOOSA and the ITU.},

Publication of structured data on the World Wide Web is in itself insufficient; in order to make use of such data, members of the public can best absorb data when it can be used with other published data. Linked Data approaches address key requirements of open government by providing a family of international standards and best practices for the publication, dissemination and reuse of structured data. Further, Linked Data, unlike previous data formatting and publication approaches, provides a simple mechanism for combining data from multiple sources across the Web. This chapter provides a six-step ``cookbook'' to model, create, publish and announce government Linked Data. We'll highlight the role of the World Wide Web Consortium, an international standards organization and its member organizations who are currently driving specifications and best practices for the publication of governmental data. The chapter concludes with guidance on the social contract government agencies implicitly adopt when they publish Linked Data on the Web.},

	Abstractnote = {Software maintenance is, often by far, the largest portion of the software lifecycle in terms of both cost and time. Yet, in spite of thirty years of study of the mechanisms and attributes of maintenance activities, there exist a number of significant open problems in the field: Software still becomes unmaintainable with time. Software maintenance failures result in significant economic costs because unmaintainable systems generally require wholesale replacement. Maintenance failures occur primarily because software systems and information about them diverge quickly in time. This divergence is typically a consequence of the loss of coupling between software components and system metadata that eventually results in an inability to understand or safely modify a system. Accurate documentation of software systems, long the proposed solution for maintenance problems, is rarely achieved and even more rarely maintained. Inaccurate documentation may exacerbate maintenance costs when it misdirects the understanding of maintainers.},

Collaboration graphs were produced at the package, class and method levels. The collaboration graphs were found to form networks which exhibited approximately scale-free properties at all three levels and during each period analyzed. This finding tends to support claims made by others that software class collaboration graphs approximate scale-free networks and provides new insights that they seem to retain the scale-free properties across different levels of granularity and over the course of their development life cycle. Significant differences between the magnitudes of power law exponents identified and those found in C and C++ applications by previous researchers are noted and discussed. Specifically, only the method-level collaboration graphs were found to have power law exponents in the most common range for scale-free networks (2 < γ < 3).},

Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth and interest in developing smart systems, enabling the identification of innovative solutions for industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors. Various applications have been built and deployed in IoT space that leverage the increasing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless, mobile, and sensor devices. However, the current IoT paradigm with traditional cloud-based architecture is not scaled for the future, and requires all data to be transferred to a central point for analysis and action. This centralized processing model presents numerous challenges with the future need to connect hundreds of billions of devices. The major bottlenecks are associated with various dimensions such as cost of connectivity, meaningful value creation from sensor data, reliability, establishing digital trust, traceability, preventing concentration of power, unmanageable complexity, security, privacy, and latency. One solution to overcome these hurdles is to bring the concept of decentralization to the IoT space to build distributed IoT. This paper presents the current state of the research on IoT and its potential business use cases along with a case study on distributed IoT. It also discusses various challenges and opportunities in decentralized ecosystems, along with open research questions and future directions.},

Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario.},

	Abstractnote = {This paper proposes a solution to facilitate on-orbit satellite communication data integrity and security by utilizing blockchain technology. A proliferating demand has created a growing reliance on satellites for communications, GPS, imagery, and other uses. The decreased cost of entry into the space industry has increased the number of entrants and also the number of satellites and the amount of space debris. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to spacecraft. Therefore, tracking these objects is crucial. Blockchain technology offers a unique solution to this problem by utilizing functions, processes, and information already incorporated into satellites while maintaining a maximum of forty-eight hours of data. The use of blockchain provides a high level of trusted positional data that can be used to predict and avoid collisions which will save billions of dollars and valuable time. This paper provides a technological design, rational, and risk analysis of this proposal.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The FAA mandate for national adoption of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) in 2020 does not include provisions for maintaining these same aircraft-privacy options, nor does it address the potential for spoofing, denial of service, and other well-documented risk factors. This paper presents an engineering prototype that embodies a design and method that may be applied to mitigate these ADS-B security issues. The design innovation is the use of an open source permissioned blockchain framework to enable aircraft privacy and anonymity while providing a secure and efficient method for communication with Air Traffic Services, Operations Support, or other authorized entities. This framework features certificate authority, smart contract support, and higher-bandwidth communication channels for private information that may be used for secure communication between any specific aircraft and any particular authorized member, sharing data in accordance with the terms specified in the form of smart contracts. The prototype demonstrates how this method can be economically and rapidly deployed in a scalable modular environment.},

	Abstractnote = {Orbital debris (OD) remains as an obstacle to further space development. While efforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number of debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. Active debris removal (ADR) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic model for ADR remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of removal can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain platform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global cooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in exchange with proofs of ADR. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through contributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal of debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have generalized this concept as proof of disposal, which, we believe, provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital currency than many Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering in practice today. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each ADR and automated pricing of tokens that represent the OD being removed are indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is ongoing.},

As the number of email users swells, and as email takes on an ever greater role in personal and business communication, Internet mail protocols have become not just an enabling technology for messaging, but a programming interface on top of which core applications are built.Programming Internet Email unmasks the Internet Mail System and shows how a loose federation of connected networks have combined to form the world's largest and most heavily trafficked message system.Programming Internet Email tames the Internet's most popular messaging service. For programmers building applications on top of email capabilities, and power users trying to get under the hood of their own email systems, Programming Internet Email stands out as an essential guide and reference book. In typical O'Reilly fashion,Programming Internet Email covers the topic with nineteen tightly written chapters and five useful appendixes.Following a thorough introduction to the Internet Mail System, the book is divided into five parts:Part I covers email formats, from basic text messages to the guts of MIME. Secure email message formats (OpenPGP and S/MIME), mailbox formats and other commonly used formats are detailed in this reference section.Part II describes Internet email protocols: SMTP and ESMTP, POP3 and IMAP4. Each protocol is covered in detail to expose the Internet Mail System's inner workings.Part III provides a solid API reference for programmers working in Perl and Java. Class references are given for commonly used Perl modules that relate to email and the Java Mail API.Part IV provides clear and concise examples of how to incorporate email capabilities into your applications. Examples are given in both Perl and Java.Part V covers the future of email on the Internet. Means and methods for controlling spam email and newly proposed Internet mail protocols are discussed.Appendixes to Programming Internet Email provide a host of explanatory information and useful references for the programmer and avid user alike, including a comprehensive list of Internet RFCs relating to email, MIME types and a list of email related URLs.Programming Internet Email will answer all of your questions about mail and extend your abilities into this most popular messaging frontier.},

The World Wide Web is the only information system that scales to the degree that it does and is robust to both changes and failure of components. Most software does not work nearly as well as the Web does. Applying the Web's architectural principles (versus using the public Web directly) for enterprise problems maybe the only way to effectively address the current and future information glut. Linking Enterprise Data is an edited volume contributed by worldwide leaders in Semantic Web research, standards development and early adopters of Semantic Web standards and techniques. Linking enterprise data is the application of World Wide Web architecture principles to real-world information management issues faced by commercial, not-for-profit and government enterprises. The first section of this book will address business, technical and social values of applying Web architecture to enterprise content. An important focus of the first section will be the building of social (human-centered) communities to curate distributed data. The second section, Infrastructure, will address the need and options for persistent identifiers of data, terms and vocabularies for use by enterprise architects, and data storage and retrieval infrastructure appropriate for use. Case studies and examples that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architectures are presented in the last section of Linking Enterprise Data. About this book: Provides practical approaches to addressing common information management issues by the application of leading edge research. Application approaches are based on international standards. Includes case studies and examples that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed architectures. This book targets professionals working as CTOs, CIOs, enterprise architects, project managers and application developers in commercial, not-for-profit and government organizations concerned with scalability, flexibility and robustness of information management systems and the Semantic Web.

	Abstractnote = {Linked Data techniques rely upon common terminology in a manner similar to a relational database'vs reliance on a schema. Linked Data terminology anchors metadata descriptions and facilitates navigation of information. Common vocabularies ease the human, social tasks of understanding datasets sufficiently to construct queries and help to relate otherwise disparate datasets. Vocabulary terms must, when using the Resource Description Framework, be grounded in URIs. A current bestpractice on the World Wide Web is to serve vocabulary terms as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and present both human-readable and machine-readable representations to the public. Linked Data terminology published to theWorldWideWeb may be used by others without reference or notification to the publishing party. That presents a problem: Vocabulary publishers take on an implicit responsibility to maintain and publish their terms via the URLs originally assigned, regardless of the inconvenience such a responsibility may cause. Over the course of years, people change jobs, publishing organizations change Internet domain names, computers change IP addresses,systems administrators publish old material in new ways. Clearly, a mechanism is required to manageWeb-based vocabularies over a long term. This chapter places Linked Data vocabularies in context with the wider concepts of metadata in general and specifically metadata on the Web. Persistent identifier mechanisms are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on Persistent URLs, or PURLs. PURLs and PURL services are discussed in the context of Linked Data. Finally, historic weaknesses of PURLs are resolved by the introduction of a federation of PURL services to address needs specific to Linked Data.},

Avoiding the overly academic terminology of the Semantic Web, this new book presents practical techniques, using everyday tools like JavaScript and Python. About this Book The current Web is mostly a collection of linked documents useful for human consumption. The evolving Web includes data collections that may be identified and linked so that they can be consumed by automated processes. The W3C approach to this is Linked Data and it is already used by Google, Facebook, IBM, Oracle, and government agencies worldwide. Linked Data presents practical techniques for using Linked Data on the Web via familiar tools like JavaScript and Python. You'll work step-by-step through examples of increasing complexity as you explore foundational concepts such as HTTP URIs, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and the SPARQL query language. Then you'll use various Linked Data document formats to create powerful Web applications and mashups. Written to be immediately useful to Web developers, this book requires no previous exposure to Linked Data or Semantic Web technologies.

In this article we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases --- Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

@article{xu_exploration_2019,
	Abstractnote = {Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control (AC) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized AC system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control (BlendCAC), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained AC solution for space system toward SSA.},
