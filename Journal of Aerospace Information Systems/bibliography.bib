	Abstract = {Space situation awareness ({SSA}) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance {SSA}, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control ({AC}) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of {SSA} systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized {AC} system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control ({BlendCAC}), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based {AC} mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in {SSA} networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the {BlendCAC} leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the {BlendCAC} scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained {AC} solution for space system toward {SSA}.},

@inproceedings{molesky_blockchain_2018,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a solution to facilitate on-orbit satellite communication data integrity and security by utilizing blockchain technology. A proliferating demand has created a growing reliance on satellites for communications, {GPS}, imagery, and other uses. The decreased cost of entry into the space industry has increased the number of entrants and also the number of satellites and the amount of space debris. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to spacecraft. Therefore, tracking these objects is crucial. Blockchain technology offers a unique solution to this problem by utilizing functions, processes, and information already incorporated into satellites while maintaining a maximum of forty-eight hours of data. The use of blockchain provides a high level of trusted positional data that can be used to predict and avoid collisions which will save billions of dollars and valuable time. This paper provides a technological design, rational, and risk analysis of this proposal.},

	Abstract = {Earth Observing 1  satellite has an imaging spectrometer  instrument called Hyperion. The satellite is able to image any spot on Earth in the nadir looking direction every 16 days. With slewing of the satellite and allowing for up to a 23 degree view angle, any spot on the Earth can be imaged approximately every 2 to 3 days. {EO}-1 has been used to track many natural hazards such as wildfires, volcanoes and floods. An enhanced capability that is sought is the ability to image natural hazards in a daily time series for space based imaging spectrometers. The Hyperion can not provide this capability on {EO}-1 with the present polar orbit. However, a constellation of cubesats each powered with Intelligent Payload Modules, and each with copies of a commercial imaging spectrometer, positioned strategically in the same orbit, can be used to provide daily coverage, cost-effectively.},

@incollection{jennath_distributed_2019,
	Abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) has given rise to a vast network of connected smart objects, leading to the development of cyber-physical pervasive frameworks. Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth and interest in developing smart systems, enabling the identification of innovative solutions for industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors. Various applications have been built and deployed in {IoT} space that leverage the increasing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification ({RFID}), wireless, mobile, and sensor devices. However, the current {IoT} paradigm with traditional cloud-based architecture is not scaled for the future, and requires all data to be transferred to a central point for analysis and action. This centralized processing model presents numerous challenges with the future need to connect hundreds of billions of devices. The major bottlenecks are associated with various dimensions such as cost of connectivity, meaningful value creation from sensor data, reliability, establishing digital trust, traceability, preventing concentration of power, unmanageable complexity, security, privacy, and latency. One solution to overcome these hurdles is to bring the concept of decentralization to the {IoT} space to build distributed {IoT}. This paper presents the current state of the research on {IoT} and its potential business use cases along with a case study on distributed {IoT}. It also discusses various challenges and opportunities in decentralized ecosystems, along with open research questions and future directions.},

@article{burleigh_delay-tolerant_2003,
	Abstract = {Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a "least common denominator" protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking ({DTN}) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the {DTN} architecture promises easier deployment and extension.{\textbackslash}},

@article{saito_digital_2019,
	Abstract = {Orbital debris ({OD}) remains as an obstacle to further space development. While efforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number of debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. Active debris removal ({ADR}) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic model for {ADR} remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of removal can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain platform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global cooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in exchange with proofs of {ADR}. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through contributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal of debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have generalized this concept as proof of disposal, which, we believe, provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital currency than many Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering in practice today. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each {ADR} and automated pricing of tokens that represent the {OD} being removed are indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is ongoing.},

Whereas previous algorithms assumed a synchronous system or were too slow to be used in practice, the algorithm described in this paper is practical: it works in asynchronous environments like the Internet and incorporates several important optimizations that improve the response time of previous algorithms by more than an order of magnitude. We implemented a Byzantine-fault-tolerant {NFS} service using our algorithm and measured its performance. The results show that our service is only 3\% slower than a standard unreplicated {NFS}.},

	Abstract = {Istanbul {BFT} is inspired by Castro-Liskov 99 paper. However, the original {PBFT} needed quite a bit of tweaking to make it work with blockchain. First off, there is no specific "client" which sends out requests and waits for the results. Instead, all of the validators can be seen as clients. Furthermore, to keep the blockchain progressing, a proposer will be continuously selected in each round to create block proposal for consensus. Also, for each consensus result, we expect to generate a verifiable new block rather than a bunch of read/write operations to the file system.},

	Abstract = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or intrinsic value and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably more important - part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (colored coins), the ownership of an underlying physical device (smart property), non-fungible assets such as domain names (Namecoin), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules (smart contracts) or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations ({DAOs}). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency.

In this article we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases --- Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

@article{dwork_consensus_1988,
	Abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a messageto be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \% on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cpexist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardlessof the actual values of the bounds A and Cp.In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardlessof when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensusprotocols are given for various casesof partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most casesthat our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensusprotocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant ``distributed clocks'' that allow partially synchronous processorsto reach some approximately common notion of time.},

@inproceedings{green_mitigation_2018,
	Abstract = {Previous activities in developing satellite networks for telecommunications such as the {TelStar}, Relay and
Syncom satellite networks of the early 1960s through to the Iridium, Globalstar and {ORBCOMM} constellations of the 1990s were reserved to geostationary orbits and low-earth orbits with less than 100 satellites comprising their network. These satellite networks distinguished themselves by being business-to-government and business-to- business facing by contracting with government and domestic carriage and media providers in the supply of services. Customers for these services did not constitute either small to medium sized businesses, or an ordinary class of
persons that constituted the general public.
However, with the advent of what has been dubbed `{NewSpace}', new entrants into the market are developing
constellation satellite networks that operate in Low Earth Orbit ({LEO}). Unlike the legacy satellite telecommunication networks of the 1960s-1990s, these constellation satellite networks are focused on, inter alia, Internet of Things ({IOT}) devices, asset management and tracking, Wi-Fi hot-spotting, backhaul networking and contracting with small
business and the general public.
Regional examples of these new telecommunication heavyweights include Fleet - an Australian company
undertaking to launch 100 satellites into {LEO}, Sky and Space Global ({SAS}) - an Australian-British-Israeli consortium that intends to provide a constellation of 200 small satellites, {OneWeb}'s planned fleet of 650 satellites that may be expanded to 2 000 satellites, and, {SpaceX}'s planned {StarLink} network of 12 000 satellites. In addition to these planned telecommunication constellation networks, companies such as Spire and {PlanetLabs} intend to provide geospatial information through their own constellation networks to government and educational institutions
alongside the private sector.
Although propertisation of space and celestial bodies is prohibited pursuant to the Outer Space Treaty 1967 ({UN}),
orbits within space still remain rivalrous and commercially lucrative. By operating in a {LEO} environment, these satellite constellation networks automatically exclude competing services. For example, where one constellation network has an orbital plane or orbital shell, another constellation may not have the same orbital plane or orbital
shell.
Presently, the literature to date focuses on the allocation of spectrum bandwidth, and space traffic management
with a focus on orbital debris mitigation. This paper addresses these concerns and offers recommendations on how the risk of `natural' monopolies forming amongst low earth orbit for specific constellation satellite networks may be
mitigated under a variety of instruments available to both {UNOOSA} and the {ITU}.},

privacy for military and corporate operations by procedurally preventing
public release of selected flight plans, position, and state data. The {FAA}

an engineering prototype that embodies a design and method that may be
applied to mitigate these {ADS}-B security issues. The design innovation is the
use of an open source permissioned blockchain framework to enable aircraft
privacy and anonymity while providing a secure and efficient method for
communication with Air Traffic Services, Operations Support, or other
authorized entities. This framework features certificate authority, smart
contract support, and higher-bandwidth communication channels for private
information that may be used for secure communication between any specific
aircraft and any particular authorized member, sharing data in accordance
with the terms specified in the form of smart contracts. The prototype
demonstrates how this method can be economically and rapidly deployed in a
